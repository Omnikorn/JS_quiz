If the user selects the correct answer, they receive 10 points in the score area and are presented with the next question.

If they however select the wrong answer a time penalty of 10 seconds is deducted from the total time and the user is then presented with the next question. 

The game ends when either all questions have been answered or the timer reaches zero. 
When the game ends an “endgame function” is called and this presents the user a message giving them their final score and gives them the option to enter their name to save their score locally and then to retake the quiz if they wanted .

Some of the quiz questions have been taken from w3schools.com JavaScript online quiz (https://www.w3schools.com/quiztest/quiztest.asp?qtest=JS).
